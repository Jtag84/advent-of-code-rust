<p>The disk map uses a dense format to represent the layout of <em>files</em> and <em>free space</em> on the disk. The digits alternate between indicating the length of a file and the length of free space.</p>
<p>So, a disk map like <code>12345</code> would represent a one-block file, two blocks of free space, a three-block file, four blocks of free space, and then a five-block file. A disk map like <code>90909</code> would represent three nine-block files in a row (with no free space between them).</p>
<p>Each file on disk also has an <em>ID number</em> based on the order of the files as they appear <em>before</em> they are rearranged, starting with ID <code>0</code>. So, the disk map <code>12345</code> has three files: a one-block file with ID <code>0</code>, a three-block file with ID <code>1</code>, and a five-block file with ID <code>2</code>. Using one character for each block where digits are the file ID and <code>.</code> is free space, the disk map <code>12345</code> represents these individual blocks:</p>
0..111....22222
00...111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.888899
<p>The amphipod would like to <em>move file blocks one at a time</em> from the end of the disk to the leftmost free space block (until there are no gaps remaining between file blocks). For the disk map <code>12345</code>, the process looks like this:</p>
0..111....22222
02.111....2222.
